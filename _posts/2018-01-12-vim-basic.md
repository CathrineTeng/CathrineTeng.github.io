# Preface
The first time I used vim I could not do anything or moving one step, and getting knowlage of modes makes me could use it as an editor, I mean, at least I could insert something into the file. 

The second thing I have learned is about some comman commands in `normal mode` where dealing the keyboard input as command to do specific operations, for instance saving change, exiting vim, and searching something.
There are many commands in vim and part is used for editing, like deleting in various ways, copying as you wishand so on.

For then, I thought I got it basically(Wow, it's pretty ridiculus), but it bothered me why people said vim is powerful. I used vim to edit web files like html, js, without considering my typing rate, it is not efficiency. Constract to other IDE, the vim looks so simple without auto-complete, highlighting and other usual functions. So the configuration of vim starts there. Vim has great flexibility and extendibility by its lush plugins. 

According to my personal above experience of dancing with vim, this post would introduce the basics in order to help the freshman go into the world of vim.


# Content Table
1. [Vim Intro](#vim-intro)
 
   Introduce the background of vim and fellowing the trend to commend its power. Yep, this magical tool do worth it.
2. [Vim Modes](#vim-modes)

   To help you start to use it by figuring out which is the enter door.

3. [Vim Common Commands](#vim-common-commands)

   This section is to make you feel better to use it as an editor with the commands dealing with basic tasks of an editor. Including moving cursor, changing modes, and deleting, copying and pasting contents.

4. [Vim Configuration](#vim-configuration)

   Firstly introduce the config file with simple config sentences. To make the vim more situation adjustment is its plugins. I will introduce how to manage the plugins in a usual way.

5. [Useful Resources](#references)

   There are many good resources of vim in the Internet and I list some ones I have read meanwhile recommended. 

# Vim Intro 
According to the url I judge [this site](https://www.vim.org/) should be the official website of vim.

Vim is a highly configurable text editor for efficiently creating and changing any kind of text. There is a noun **vi** looking similar as vim, which is a built-in editor of all Unix-like systems. And vim could be thought of an upgraded version of it, which means vim is more powerfu and could be support in all Unix-like systems by default. You could use it nearly in any system.

In the age of rapid change, vim still has a large proportion users as a tool with some history. This also could proof something.

# Vim Modes
As the above said, vim could be running in all Unix-like system, so just open your terminal, and type
> $ vim filename

and now you should have entered vim environment. Don't be in a hurry to type anything out, as you wouldn't see any character you entered.
When you are in vim you just in one specific state of vim, and you could switch current state anytime. We called the state as mode. 
Vim has a conception of modes to be responsible for different things.
By default, vim is on `normal mode` when you first start it.

There are three modes totally:
* normal mode: also known as command mode. All keystrokes are interpreted as commands
* insert mode: most keystrokes are inserted as text(leaving out those with modifier keys)
* visual mode: helps to visually select some text, may been seen as a submode of the command mode. And this post wouldn't talk about it.

And `normal mode` and `insert mode` should be cared about first for a novice.
The `insert mode` of vim deal with the keyboard input as normal to edit the file content.

If you want to enter the `insert mode` from the `normal mode`(belonged to command mode), you could type <kbd>i</kbd>, <kbd>a</kbd>, <kbd>I</kbd> or <kbd>A</kbd>. 
And they aren't just simple eplacements, there are some slight difference.
* <kbd>i</kbd>: switch to insert mode before the current position
* <kbd>a</kbd>: switch to insert mode after the current postion
* <kbd>I</kbd>: switch to insert mode and jump to the first non-black character in the current line 
* <kbd>A</kbd>: switch to insert mode and jump to the last character of thecurrent line

Actually there are other ways to enter `insert mode` by other keystrokes. You could find nearly everything of vim in the help-file which is included in the vim progress. And you could read it by input
> :help

in the `normal mode`. The colon is the start sign for command line, and it is necessary to type.

And if you want reversely switch the modes you could enter <kbd>Esc</kbd>.

# Vim Common Commands
This part is the real meat for the vim dinner. And command has two forms
* ## Working with file 
* ## Movement in the file
* ## Searching text 
* ## Deleting text 
* ## Copy and Paste 
* ## Redo and Undo

# Vim Configuration
As people really have different works, the target of vim is various, you could search well-directed configuration in the Internet.
This section only introduces the most basic.

The configuration file is ~/.vimrc where you could change its content to implement the customization. And this file located in ~ directory will only determine the vim behavior for the current operating system user.

If you are a newbie for vim, don't copy a lengthy and complex config from the network into your own config file. Trust me, it won't be good for you.
What is good for you, start with a basic setup but not zero, and nearly every line you know what it means.

    " enable syntax highlighting
    syntax enable

    " show line numbers
    set number

    " set tabs to have 4 spaces
    set ts=4

    " indent when moving to the next line while writing code
    set autoindent

    " expand tabs into spaces
    set expandtab

    " when using the >> or << commands, shift lines by 4 spaces
    set shiftwidth=4

    " show a visual line under the cursor's current line
    set cursorline

    " show the matching part of the pair for [] {} and ()
    set showmatch

    " enable all Python syntax highlighting features
    let python_highlight_all = 1

    " map jk to <ESC>
    inoremap jk <ESC>


This is one way to configure with some specific instruction like **inoremap** in whcih you can define you own command by mapping them to vim original command, and **set keyword** to set up something. 
So you could type  <kbd>j</kbd><kbd>k</kbd> instead of <kbd>Esc</kbd>. People have set this because it is "a little far" to reach the <kbd>Esc</kbd> when you are typing in the main area of keybord and it influences efficiency. 

But this way only could do "limited" things. Some people use vim more than an text editor but an IDE. Some complicated features could implemented by vim plugins.

Vim has ample plugins, and there are ways to manage these plugins. 
The following two are the main way to take vim plugins management.
And most vim plugins in github have the instructions to help you install their with following methods.

* Vundle: short for VIM Bundle. It is also a vim plugin itself which provide a clean easy way to manage other plugins in an elegent way.
* Pathogen

## Vimrc Resources
* [A Good Vimrc](http://dougblack.io/words/a-good-vimrc.html) is a detailed overview and opinionated guide to configure vim.
* This [repository's folder with Vimrc files](https://github.com/amix/vimrc/tree/master/vimrcs) has examples configurations that are well commented and easy to learn from.
